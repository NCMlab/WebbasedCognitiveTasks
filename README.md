# WebbasedCognitiveTasks
 
This is a collection of web-based cognitive tasks written in [jsPsych.](#https://jspsych.org) My personal goal is to have the scripts run using [JATOS](#https://jatos.org). 

To maximize the sharability of this code, each task will include a document written in Google style docstrings. This document will describe the task, the scientific literature source for the task as well as modifiable parameters for the tasks.

The plan is to develop a large list of tasks which will ultimately be integrated into jsPsych itself as additional examples.
